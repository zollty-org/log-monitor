# log-monitor
A java library for log monitoring and management, base on [jretty-log](https://github.com/jretty-org/jretty-log) (a Monitor Logging Facade for Java).

jretty-log and log-monitor Mlf4j is a facade or abstraction for various logging frameworks (e.g. java.util.logging, logback, log4j) allowing the end user to plug in the desired logging framework at deployment time. It is not only a facade, but also provides some useful decorations for common logging frameworks, such as log monitoring, online log viewer, configuration dynamic refreshing.
