# log-monitor
A java library for log monitoring and management, base on [zollty-log](http://www.zollty.com/zollty-log/) (a Monitor Logging Facade for Java).

zollty-log and log-monitor Mlf4j is a facade or abstraction for various logging frameworks (e.g. java.util.logging, logback, log4j) allowing the end user to plug in the desired logging framework at deployment time. It is not only a facade, but also provides some useful decorations for common logging frameworks, such as log monitoring, online log viewer, configuration dynamic refreshing.
